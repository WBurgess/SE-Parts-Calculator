SE-Parts-Calculator
===================

Parts Calculator for Space Engineers desktop application. Helps users figure out how many components are necessary for a build.

Project was abandoned since I'd rather see this as a single-page web application akin to MMO talent calculators, so I'm re-building it with ASP.net and knockout.js. About 85% complete as of this writing (!) Had lots of fun working in knockout.

This was written in C# & XAML on .Net 4.5 using VS Express for Desktop
